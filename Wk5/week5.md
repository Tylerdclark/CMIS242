## What do think is meant by programming to an interface"?"

Programming to an interface, as I understand it, is a programming technique. When programming to an interface, what your code does is more important than how it is done. You can have methods stubs that are meant for losely-specific behavior. It allows an increased level of flexibilty in use and adaptibility over time.

## What are some differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces"?"

A common comparison is that an interface is a sort of contract (and we have said this in class). An interface has empty methods which point the direction in which the programming should be doing, but not necessaily assigning the specifics of the behavior. Abstract classes take it a bit forward and can proivide some of that specific behavior and functionality. Each one has its benefits and limitations
